# 20questions
The game 20 questions is a game where an answerer chooses a subject (it is usually a person, place or object) and a guesser gets 20 "Yes or No" questions to figure out what the answerer is thinking of. For extra credit, you are going to write a program that acts as the guesser in a similar game where only 5 questions are used. Use 5_questions.py.
